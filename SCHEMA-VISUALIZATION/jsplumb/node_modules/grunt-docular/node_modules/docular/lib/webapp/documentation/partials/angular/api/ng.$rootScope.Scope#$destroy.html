<div><h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><p>Removes the current scope (and all of its children) from the parent scope. Removal implies
that calls to <a href="documentation/angular/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest"><code>$digest()</code></a> will no longer
propagate to the current scope and its children. Removal also implies that the current
scope is eligible for garbage collection.</p>

<p>The  <code class="plain">$destroy()</code>  is usually used by directives such as
<a href="documentation/angular/api/ng.directive:ngRepeat"><code>ngRepeat</code></a> for managing the
unrolling of the loop.</p>

<p>Just before a scope is destroyed a  <code class="plain">$destroy</code>  event is broadcasted on this scope.
Application code can register a  <code class="plain">$destroy</code>  event handler that will give it chance to
perform any necessary cleanup.</p></div>
