<p>Models an endpoint. Can have 1 to  <code class="plain">maxConnections</code> . Connections emanating from it (set maxConnections to -1 
to allow unlimited).  Typically, if you use 'jsPlumb.connect' to programmatically connect two elements, you won't
actually deal with the underlying Endpoint objects.  But if you wish to support drag and drop Connections, one of the ways you
do so is by creating and registering Endpoints using 'jsPlumb.addEndpoint', and marking these Endpoints as 'source' and/or
'target' Endpoints for Connections. </p>

<p>You never need to create one of these directly; jsPlumb will create them as needed.  </p></div>
